        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Working out is hard. It requires so much motivation and drive just to get to the gym. And then what do you do when you are actually there? With this app, we're working to at least solve the last problem. We can help you with strength-training exercises to do when you are at the gym</p>
        <h3>How To Do It</h3>
        <p>From the home page, just hit "Start". We'll give you 5 strength-training exercises, explain how to do them, and even give you a demo video. Work through as many repetitions as you can (we'll suggest a number to work up to). Hit "Complete" to move to the next exercise, and after 5, you're done!</p>
